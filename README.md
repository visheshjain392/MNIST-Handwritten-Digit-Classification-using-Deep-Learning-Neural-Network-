# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Neural-Network-
Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Implemented data preprocessing, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and a neural network for training and evaluation. Achieved high accuracy with confusion matrix analysis for performance insights.
