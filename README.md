ðŸ–‹ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
A deep learning project for classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. Implemented and tested in Google Colab, with visualizations, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. This project builds a Neural Network model to accurately classify these digits, leveraging Python libraries for EDA, visualization, and deep learning.
